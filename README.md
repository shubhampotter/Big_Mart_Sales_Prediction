# Big_Mart_Sales_Prediction



This project aims to predict the sales of various products in Big Mart stores using machine learning models. The project employs Random Forest Regressor and XGBoost Regressor algorithms to predict the sales values based on historical data and various features such as product attributes, store characteristics, and more.

# Project Overview

In this project, I used a dataset provided by Big Mart to predict sales for various products in different stores. The objective is to train a model that can predict future sales given different input features. The key focus of the project was to implement two different regression models — Random Forest Regressor and XGBoost Regressor — and compare their performance in terms of prediction accuracy.

Key tasks include:

1.Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical features, etc.)

2.Feature selection and engineering

3.Model training and evaluation
   
4.Model comparison using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), etc.

## Technologies Used

- Python: Programming language for data analysis and machine learning.
- Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis library.
- NumPy: Library for numerical operations.
- Matplotlib / Seaborn: Data visualization libraries.
- Scikit-learn: Machine learning library for model building and evaluation.
- XGBoost: A popular gradient boosting library for machine learning.
- Jupyter Notebook: Development environment for running the code and visualizing results.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information about the sales of products across multiple stores. The features include:
- Store information: Store type, location, and more.
- Product information: Category, size, and other attributes.
- Sales data: Historical sales values.

## Modeling Techniques

In this project, two machine learning models were implemented:

1. Random Forest Regressor
Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy. It is less prone to overfitting compared to individual decision trees.

Hyperparameters tuned: Number of trees, maximum depth, etc.

Evaluation Metrics: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

2. XGBoost Regressor
XGBoost is a gradient boosting algorithm that builds trees sequentially, with each tree trying to correct the errors of the previous one. It is known for its high performance and speed.

Hyperparameters tuned: Learning rate, max depth, number of estimators, etc.
Evaluation Metrics: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), RMSE

## Conclusion

In this project, we built a machine learning model to predict Big Mart sales using historical sales data and various product and store-related features. By leveraging the power of two popular regression algorithms — Random Forest Regressor and XGBoost Regressor, we were able to compare their performance and gain insights into the key factors influencing sales.

Both models performed well, with XGBoost Regressor slightly outperforming the Random Forest Regressor in terms of prediction accuracy.
The project highlighted the importance of data preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluation in developing effective sales prediction models.
The models can be further improved with additional feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and the inclusion of more advanced techniques, such as Stacking or Ensemble Methods.

Overall, this project demonstrates the applicability of machine learning techniques to predict sales, which can be used for demand forecasting, inventory management, and strategic planning in retail businesses.
